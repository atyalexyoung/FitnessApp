This application is to search exercises, create and track workouts.
It is in the very early stages and isn't functional yet, but hopefully it will be soon!

Currently developing the front end to be able to properly do CRUD operations, then onto deployment and then added features/updates.

For this iteration, it is ASP .NET for the backend, Angular for the front-end, PostgreSQL via EF for the data storage. 

If you want to develop, you can fill out a real .env in place of the example, get all the dependencies, and go. It may be more complex than that, but I honestly don't feel like writing more detailed instructions until the project is more fleshed out.
