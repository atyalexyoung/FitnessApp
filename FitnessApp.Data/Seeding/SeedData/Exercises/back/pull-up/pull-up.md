## Form Cues
1. Grip bar slightly wider than shoulder width, palms facing away.
2. Hang with shoulders engaged, scapula slightly retracted.
3. Pull chin above bar by driving elbows down and back.
4. Lower slowly to full hang.

## Common Mistakes
- **Kipping Too Early:** Use strict form first.
- **Shrugging Shoulders:** Keep them back and down.
- **Partial Reps:** Reduce range = less lat activation.
- **Swinging:** Avoid momentum-based movement.

## Variations
**Easier:**  
- Assisted pull-ups (band or machine)  
- Negative pull-ups  

**Harder:**  
- Weighted pull-ups  
- Slow eccentric or pause at top  

## Programming Options
- 3–4 sets × max reps  
- Include in vertical pull day  
- Can alternate grip (chin, neutral) for variety  

## Benefits
- Builds lats and upper back width  
- Strengthens biceps and grip  
- Functional upper body strength  

## Tips for Success
- Focus on scapular engagement  
- Controlled lowering is as important as pulling  
- Avoid jerky movements
