## Form Cues
1. Stand with feet shoulder-width apart, barbell over mid-foot.
2. Hinge at hips, maintain neutral spine.
3. Grip bar slightly wider than shoulder width.
4. Row bar to lower chest/upper abs, elbows close to body.
5. Lower bar under control, don’t let back round.

## Common Mistakes
- **Rounded Back:** Increases injury risk.
- **Using Momentum:** Avoid jerking with hips.
- **Elbows Flaring Out:** Reduces lat activation.
- **Partial Range:** Pull fully to chest level.

## Variations
**Easier:**  
- Dumbbell rows  
- Supported chest rows  

**Harder:**  
- Pendlay row (bar starts on floor each rep)  
- Tempo row (slow eccentric)  

## Programming Options
- 3–5 sets × 6–12 reps  
- Use as primary back mass builder  
- Can be paired with pull-ups for vertical/horizontal pull balance  

## Benefits
- Builds mid-back thickness  
- Strengthens posterior chain  
- Improves posture and pulling mechanics  

## Tips for Success
- Keep core braced  
- Lead with elbows, not hands  
- Avoid rounding spine at any point
