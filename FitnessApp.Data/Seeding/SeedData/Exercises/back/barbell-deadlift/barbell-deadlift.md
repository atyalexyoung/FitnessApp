## Form Cues
1. Stand with feet under barbell, hip-width apart.
2. Grip bar just outside knees, neutral spine.
3. Hinge at hips, drive through heels to lift bar.
4. Lock out at top, shoulders back, glutes tight.
5. Lower bar with control, maintain back neutrality.

## Common Mistakes
- **Rounded Spine:** High injury risk.  
- **Bar Too Far from Shins:** Reduces leverage.  
- **Hyperextending at Top:** Keep neutral spine.  
- **Jerking off Floor:** Smooth pull only.  

## Variations
**Easier:**  
- Trap bar deadlift  
- Romanian deadlift  

**Harder:**  
- Deficit deadlift  
- Pause deadlift  

## Programming Options
- 3–5 sets × 3–6 reps (strength)  
- Accessory work: Romanian deadlifts, good mornings  
- Pair with rows for posterior chain balance  

## Benefits
- Builds total-body strength  
- Develops posterior chain  
- Improves grip, posture, and core stability  

## Tips for Success
- Maintain tight core throughout lift  
- Engage lats before pulling  
- Don’t jerk or bounce the weight
