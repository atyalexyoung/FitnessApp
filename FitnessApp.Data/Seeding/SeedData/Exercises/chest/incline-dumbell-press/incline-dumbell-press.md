## Form Cues
1. Set bench at 30–45° incline.
2. Hold dumbbells at shoulder height, palms forward.
3. Press upward and slightly toward midline.
4. Lower with control until elbows are about 90°.
5. Keep chest high, shoulders pinned.

## Common Mistakes
- **Too High Incline:** Overworks shoulders, underloads chest.
- **Touching Dumbbells Too Early:** Maintain tension at top.
- **Arching Excessively:** Keep ribs down, back tight.

## Variations
**Easier:**  
- Use lighter weight or lower incline  
- Machine incline press  

**Harder:**  
- Slow eccentric phase  
- Neutral grip incline press  

## Programming Options
- **Hypertrophy:** 3–4 sets × 8–12 reps  
- **Upper Chest Focus:** Add after flat press day  
- **Superset:** With flys for burnout  

## Benefits
- Targets upper pecs effectively  
- Builds shoulder stability  
- Improves pressing balance  

## Tips for Success
- Don’t lock elbows at top  
- Control every rep  
- Keep wrists neutral
