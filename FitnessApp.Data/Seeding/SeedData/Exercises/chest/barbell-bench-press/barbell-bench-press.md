## Form Cues
1. Lie flat on the bench with eyes under the bar.
2. Grip slightly wider than shoulder width.
3. Retract shoulder blades and plant feet firmly.
4. Unrack bar, lower to mid-chest with control.
5. Press explosively back up, keeping wrists straight.

## Common Mistakes
- **Flaring Elbows:** Causes shoulder strain; keep elbows at ~45°.
- **Bouncing the Bar:** Control the descent; no rebounding off chest.
- **Losing Upper Back Tightness:** Maintain scapular retraction.
- **Unstable Feet:** Keep full contact with floor for stability.

## Variations
**Easier:**  
- Smith machine bench press  
- Use lighter load or partial range  

**Harder:**  
- Pause reps at bottom  
- Tempo bench (3s eccentric)  
- Reverse band bench press  

## Programming Options
- **Strength:** 3–5 sets × 3–6 reps @ 75–90% 1RM  
- **Hypertrophy:** 4 sets × 8–12 reps  
- **Powerlifting Peak:** Heavy singles/doubles, full rest between  

## Benefits
- Builds upper body pressing power  
- Strengthens chest, shoulders, triceps  
- Key movement for strength metrics  

## Tips for Success
- Keep tight from feet to hands  
- Control bar path (slight arc back up)  
- Don’t overextend lower back  
- Get a spotter for max attempts
