## Form Cues
1. Set cables to shoulder height.
2. Step forward into split stance.
3. Pull handles together in front of chest.
4. Slowly return to start, keeping tension.

## Common Mistakes
- **Overextending Arms Back:** Shoulder strain risk.
- **Rushing Reps:** Lose constant tension.
- **Elbows Locked:** Keep slight bend.

## Variations
**Easier:**  
- Use lighter weight  
- Higher pulley angle  

**Harder:**  
- Low-to-high or high-to-low flys  
- Slow tempo  

## Programming Options

- Add to end of chest workout  

## Benefits
- Constant tension for chest hypertrophy  
- Safer on shoulders than heavy flys  

## Tips for Success
- Maintain same arc each rep  
- Slight lean forward
