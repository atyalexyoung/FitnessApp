## Form Cues
1. Grip parallel bars and lift body.
2. Lean forward slightly to target chest.
3. Lower until elbows hit 90°.
4. Press back up, maintaining forward lean.

## Common Mistakes

## Benefits
- Builds lower chest and triceps  
- Increases pressing power  
- Develops bodyweight strength  

## Tips for Success
