## Common Mistakes
- Leaning too far forward/back  
- Moving too fast  
- Not controlling band  

## Variations
**Easier:**

- Shorter range  

**Harder:**

- Longer hold or slow controlled motion  

## Programming Options
- 3–5 sets × 10–15 reps per direction  
- Include in warm-ups, rehab, or mobility routines  

## Benefits
- Improves ankle dorsiflexion  
- Enhances squat mechanics  
- Reduces injury risk  

## Tips for Success
